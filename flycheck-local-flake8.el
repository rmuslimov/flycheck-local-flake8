;;; Commentary:

;; Override default flychek-flake8 checker, and ability to use
;; configured virtualenv for existing project and setup.cfg if exists
;; Based on assumption that project's directory name matches virtualenv name
;; and WORKON_HOME variable from environment configured.

;;; Code:

(require 'f)
(require 'flycheck)


(defun flycheck-local-flake8/get-venv-from-project-path (projectpath)
  "Get env path based on folder, of no venv, assume that venv name same as foldername."
  (if (f-exists? (f-join projectpath "venv"))
	  (f-join projectpath "venv")
	(let ((workon-home (or (getenv "WORKON_HOME") "~/.virtualenvs")))
	  (f-join (expand-file-name workon-home)
			  (car (last (split-string projectpath "/")))))))
